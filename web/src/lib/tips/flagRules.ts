// Manager-adjustable flag rules for the Tip Dashboard.
//
// The phone saves two kinds of flag onto tip_entries.anomaly_reason: the
// literal "day_total_no_lunch" (a whole-day dinner saved before lunch was
// recorded) and the save-time statistical check ("cash $500.00 vs typical
// $10-$30 (max ever $40)"), joined with "; " when both apply. The rules here
// decide which of those the dashboard treats as "needs attention", and add
// two plain limits (cash over $X, card over $Y) evaluated on the dashboard.
// Everything is display-time: changing a rule re-evaluates history, and
// Verify still clears a row by stamping flag_verified_at.
