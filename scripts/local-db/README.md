# Local migration verification harness

`supabase start` cannot bootstrap this project locally: the migrations folder
starts mid-stream (the earliest migration already assumes `public.locations`,
`public.users`, `public.inventory_items`, `public.orders`, `public.order_items`
and `public.suppliers` exist, because those tables predate migration adoption).
So historical migrations can never be replayed from zero.

This harness answers a narrower, more useful question instead:

> **Do the migrations that are NEW on this branch apply cleanly against the
> CURRENT production schema?**

## What's in here

| File | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `baseline_public_schema.sql` | Full DDL snapshot of prod's `public` schema (project `whrohvitvmcrmedepurd`): 75 tables with columns/defaults/generated columns, PK/unique/check constraints, FKs, 2 sequences, 55 functions, 45 triggers, all non-constraint indexes, RLS enablement and all 142 policies. Generated 2026-08-11 via read-only `pg_catalog` / `information_schema` queries (`pg_get_constraintdef`, `pg_get_indexdef`, `pg_get_functiondef`, `pg_get_triggerdef`, `pg_policies`). |
| `auth_stub.sql` | Minimal stand-in for Supabase-managed dependencies: roles `anon` / `authenticated` / `service_role`, an `auth` schema with a minimal `auth.users` table, and `auth.uid()` / `auth.role()` / `auth.jwt()` stubs that read the `request.jwt.claim.*` GUCs (null-safe). |
| `verify-migrations.sh` | The runner. Disposable `postgres:17` Docker container on a Docker-assigned localhost port; loads `auth_stub.sql`, then `baseline_public_schema.sql`, then applies every migration newer than the snapshot cutoff plus any older branch-new migration, in timestamp order. Each SQL file runs with `--single-transaction`, so a failed migration does not leave a partial schema. The runner fails on the first error and removes the container through an EXIT trap unless `--keep` is passed. |

## Usage

```sh
# From anywhere in the repo (docker required):
scripts/local-db/verify-migrations.sh

# Keep the container running afterwards for inspection:
scripts/local-db/verify-migrations.sh --keep
#   connect with: docker exec -it <container> psql -U postgres
```

Exit code 0 and a final `PASS:` line means every branch-new migration applied
cleanly on top of the production baseline. A `FAIL:` line names the first
migration that broke and how many applied before it.

Note: "new on this branch" is computed against your local `origin/main` ref.
Run `git fetch origin main` first if it might be stale.

### How agents use this per phase

1. Write your phase's migration(s) into `supabase/migrations/` with a
   timestamped filename (later than everything on `origin/main`).
2. Run `scripts/local-db/verify-migrations.sh` and require `PASS` before
   considering the phase's DB work done. The script picks up every migration
   after the baseline snapshot and all branch-new migrations, so cross-phase
   ordering conflicts are caught early even after older work reaches main.
3. If you need to poke at the resulting schema (check a column, run an
   EXPLAIN, test an RPC), re-run with `--keep` and connect with psql.
4. To simulate an authenticated user in the kept container:
   `SELECT set_config('request.jwt.claim.sub', '<some-uuid>', false);` then
   `SET ROLE authenticated;` (the stub's `auth.uid()` reads that GUC).

### Phase 5a checklist fixture

The Phase 5a fixture seeds nine observed Sushi item-order days for one fake
user, with a frequent item (6/9 days), an occasional item (2/9), and a rare
item (one occurrence).
It runs `generate_order_checklist` as that user and prints the generated rows.

```sh
scripts/local-db/verify-migrations.sh --keep
# Copy the container name printed after `--keep`, then:
docker exec -i <container-name> psql -U postgres -d postgres \
  -v ON_ERROR_STOP=1 < scripts/local-db/phase5a_checklist_fixture.sql
docker rm -f <container-name>
```

The expected result has `Frequent Tuna` / `frequent` / `4.5`, `Occasional
Salmon` / `occasional` / `10`, and `Rare Nori` / `rare` / `1`, in that sort
order. The fixture is intentionally separate from the general migration
harness so the harness remains data-free for every phase.

### Onboarding/auth fixture

After a kept migration run, execute the onboarding/auth fixture to prove the
login-credential and invite-defaults backend:

```sh
docker exec -i <container-name> psql -U postgres -d postgres \
  -v ON_ERROR_STOP=1 < scripts/local-db/onboarding_auth_fixture.sql
```

It prints fourteen `ok:` notices covering: the `ordering_simple` employee
default flip in `get_effective_modules` (and that explicit `user_modules`
rows still override it), `set_my_login_credential` normalization + bcrypt
hashing + format validation + duplicate-name refusal,
`verify_login_credential` success/invalid/rate-limit (6 failures per name in
10 minutes) and suspended-account refusal, `reset_login_credential`
manager gating + PIN rotation + suspended-target refusal, atomic onboarding
credential creation, invite-safe account deletion, the seeded
`employee_invite_module_defaults` app_config row and its manager-gated
validated writes, and `set_user_default_location` gating with `null`
meaning "both". It ends with
`PASS: onboarding auth fixture assertions all held` and rolls back.

### Phase 6c holiday-template fixture

After a kept migration run, execute the Phase 6c fixture to prove that holiday
templates are a non-destructive checklist overlay:

```sh
docker exec -i <container-name> psql -U postgres -d postgres \
  -v ON_ERROR_STOP=1 < scripts/local-db/phase6c_holiday_templates_fixture.sql
```

It creates a `Fixture New Year` window from 2026-12-24 through 2026-12-26.
Its date probe prints zero rows on 2026-12-23 and 2026-12-27, and three rows
inside the window: Tuna `scale 1.5`, Salmon `set_qty 8`, and Nori `add 3`.
The fixture also asserts that Tuna's stored generated quantity remains `4` and
that the additive Nori line was never inserted into `order_checklist_items`.

### Kitchen requests fixture

After a kept migration run, execute the kitchen requests fixture:

```sh
docker exec -i <container-name> psql -U postgres -d postgres \
  -v ON_ERROR_STOP=1 < scripts/local-db/kitchen_requests_fixture.sql
```

It checks the six seeded items, module defaults, RPC errors and transitions,
idempotent sends, actor identity, location scope, suspension, and RLS for
display, no-module, and anonymous users. It ends with
`PASS: kitchen requests fixture assertions all held` and rolls back.

### Push token ownership fixture

After a kept migration run, execute the push token ownership fixture:

```sh
docker exec -i <container-name> psql -U postgres -d postgres \
  -v ON_ERROR_STOP=1 < scripts/local-db/push_token_ownership_fixture.sql
```

It proves the three clauses of the shared-device rule: registering a token
claims it, the claim deactivates prior owners' rows for that token only, and
`active_device_push_tokens` never returns a token the recipient no longer owns
(including a stale active row that a later claim outranks, and a late sign-out
whose `updated_at` is newer than the active owner's claim). It rewinds and
reapplies the ownership migration inside the fixture transaction to cover the
backfill. Cases include leading and trailing U+FEFF, U+00A0, both wrapped
around one token, and a newer inactive canonical row beside an older active
padded alias. Runtime checks cover the same Unicode canonicalization, exact
token grammar, inactive-insert rejection, the server-owned ownership clock,
reverse handover, the one-active-owner unique index, unchanged per-user RLS,
and the service-role-only resolver grant. It ends with
`PASS: push token ownership fixture assertions all held` and rolls back.

The fixture restates the table grants itself, because the baseline snapshot is
DDL-only.

Concurrent claims need two connections, so they live in a separate script:

```sh
scripts/local-db/push_token_concurrency_check.sh <container-name>
```

Two users register the same token with no active row to arbitrate between
them. It asserts the later registration wins and no unique violation is raised,
and it fails if the second session did not actually contend for the lock. It
cleans up its own rows and leaves the container running.

## What this does NOT prove

- **No gotrue / real auth.** `auth` is a stub: only `auth.users(id, email,
  raw_user_meta_data, raw_app_meta_data, created_at)` and stubbed
  `uid()/role()/jwt()`. Prod's triggers **on `auth.users`** (identity-sync
  trigger wiring) are not reproduced; the public-schema trigger *functions*
  they call do exist. Signup/login flows are out of scope.
- **No gotrue, realtime, edge functions, pg_net, pg_cron, or vault.** Storage
  has a deliberately minimal `buckets` / `objects` / `foldername` stand-in so
  bucket declarations and object RLS policies can be verified. Networked and
  scheduler integrations remain production-only and are expected to install
  dormantly when their extensions are unavailable.
- **No data.** The baseline is DDL-only. Migrations whose correctness depends
  on production data shapes (backfills, constraint validation over existing
  rows) only prove they *parse and execute* on an empty schema here.
- **Grants/ownership are approximate.** Roles exist so `GRANT`/`CREATE POLICY
  ... TO authenticated` statements work, but prod's exact grant matrix and
  object ownership are not mirrored; everything is owned by `postgres`.
- **Point-in-time snapshot.** The baseline reflects prod as of 2026-08-11.
  After new migrations are deployed to prod, the snapshot is stale (usually
  harmlessly, since your new migrations are also part of prod by then). If
  drift matters, regenerate the baseline from prod with the same pg_catalog
  queries.

## Known stubs / deviations from prod (documented per the generation run)

- `extensions` schema is created with `pgcrypto` and `uuid-ossp` (both exist in
  the stock `postgres:17` image). These are the only extensions prod's public
  schema actually uses (`extensions.crypt`, `gen_salt`, `digest`,
  `gen_random_bytes`, `uuid_generate_v4`). Prod additionally has
  `pg_stat_statements`, `pg_net`, `pg_cron`, `pg_graphql` and `supabase_vault`
  installed, but nothing in `public` references them, so they are omitted.
- `ALTER DATABASE postgres SET search_path TO "$user", public, extensions;`
  mirrors Supabase's database-level search_path so unqualified calls like
  `uuid_generate_v4()` in column defaults resolve identically.
- The baseline loads with `SET check_function_bodies = off`, because function
  bodies reference tables created later in the file, and because prod itself
  contains three orphaned functions (`has_org_role`, `is_org_member`,
  `org_has_members`) whose bodies reference the long-dropped
  `public.org_memberships` table. They are reproduced verbatim.
- `tip_auth_attempts_id_seq` is not created explicitly; it is auto-created by
  the `GENERATED ALWAYS AS IDENTITY` column, same as prod.
- `service_role` is created with `BYPASSRLS` to approximate Supabase behavior.
